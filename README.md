# Recipe Price Comparison Tool

## Project Context
This project focuses on building an application to search for recipes and compare the prices of required ingredients across various supermarkets (e.g., Auchan, Carrefour). With a wide range of products and fluctuating prices, this tool provides users with a practical way to plan their meals and optimize their grocery expenses.

The application is built on a user-friendly interface and leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to match recipe ingredients with products available in store catalogs.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Scraping
- **Auchan**: Extracted product details (name, price, unit, and description) from Auchan's website. The data was cleaned and normalized for usability.
- **Carrefour**: Collected similar information from Carrefour's website.
- **Marmiton (Recipe Site)**: Scraped popular recipes, including titles, ingredients, and instructions. Ingredients were pre-processed to facilitate accurate matching.

### 2. Data Processing
- **Text Cleaning and Normalization**: Removed accents, special characters, and applied lowercase transformation to standardize the data.
- **Enhancements**: Added product details such as quantities and discounts to enrich the dataset.

### 3. Model and Matching
- Implemented NLP models to compute similarities between recipe ingredients and supermarket products.
- Applied a similarity threshold to filter out weak or irrelevant matches.
- Experimented with different models to improve accuracy and reliability.

### 4. User Interface
Built an interactive application using `Tkinter`, enabling users to:
- Search for recipes by entering a title.
- View the required ingredients alongside matching products from Auchan and Carrefour.
- Compare product prices for each ingredient.

## How to Use the Project

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
Run the main script to launch the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Using the Application
- Enter the title of a recipe in the search field.
- Click the "Search" button to find matches.
- View the results, including prices and product details for each ingredient.

### Preview of Recipe and Product Matching Results
This section showcases the output of the recipe-to-product matching system. The tool takes a recipe title as input, extracts its ingredients, and identifies the best-matched products from Auchan and Carrefour databases. Below is an example of the results, demonstrating how the system pairs ingredients with corresponding products, prices, and packaging units from both retailers.

This example helps to illustrate how the system operates and the level of detail provided for each ingredient-to-product match.


### Current Issues and Future Improvements

#### Current Challenges
- Debugging the interface to ensure accurate product matching.
- Improving model precision for ingredient-to-product mapping.

#### Future Plans
- Test additional NLP models for better accuracy.
- Implement advanced filtering to exclude irrelevant products.
- Introduce dynamic quantity selection and promotion tracking
